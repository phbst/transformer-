    "This is the Hugging Face Course.",
    "This chapter is about tokenization.",
    "This section shows several tokenizer algorithms.",
    "Hopefully, you will be able to understand how they are trained and generate tokens.",
    "Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics and artificial intelligence.",
    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units.",
    "These units, called tokens, can be words, characters, or subwords.",
    "Different languages may require different tokenization strategies.",
    "Machine learning models use these tokens as input for various NLP tasks.",
    "The choice of tokenizer can significantly impact model performance.",
    "Some popular tokenization methods include word-based, character-based, and subword tokenization.",
    "Subword tokenization strikes a balance between the flexibility of characters and the meaning of words.",
    "BPE, or Byte-Pair Encoding, is a common subword tokenization algorithm.",
    "Tokenizers need to handle out-of-vocabulary words effectively.",
    "Pre-trained models often come with their own specialized tokenizers.",
